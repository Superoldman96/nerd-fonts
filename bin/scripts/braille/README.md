# Generate Appropriate Braille Font

This module is used to generate a braille font with specified width, ymax, ymin... for patching.

## Motivation

Achieving a perfect isometric font with braille support solely through scaling
appears extremely challenging. Therefore, I've opted to utilize a module for
dynamically generating braille. For further details, please refer to PR 837 and PR 1980.
