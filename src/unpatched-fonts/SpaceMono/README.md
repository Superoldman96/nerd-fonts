# Space Mono

Space Mono is an original fixed-width type family designed by Colophon Foundry for Google Design.

The `fi` and `fl` ligatures are removed because they map to only one advance width.

The arrow alternatives (e.g. `/>`) are removed because they come unexpected in almost
all cases and can not be turned off easily by many users.
